# regular-expressions
A regular expression is a kind of pattern that can be applied to text (Strings, in Java)
A regular expression either matches the text (or part of the text), or it fails to match
If a regular expression matches a part of the text, then you can easily find out which part
If a regular expression is complex, then you can easily find out which parts of the regular expression match which parts of the text
With this information, you can readily extract parts of the text, or do substitutions in the text
Regular expressions are an extremely useful tool for manipulating text
The Perl programming language is heavily used in server-side programming
